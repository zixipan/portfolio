				<br>
				<p>Our research was conducted over the course of three months and was divided into the following phases: background research, contextual interviews, affinity diagramming, and conjuring recommendations. To become informed about Domino’s history as well as the role that a uniformed innovation space can play in its agenda, our team conducted background research reports. Using our initial research, we compiled a set of questions for each role present. We then used our questions to conduct six interviews.</p>
				<p>Following our interviews, we listened to their recorded audio as well as browsed through our interview notes to document relevant information from the interviews. We then affinity diagrammed our documented insights to form a set of findings. Specifically, we wrote each insight on a sticky note and grouped the sticky notes based on their relationships to one another. Once we had established groupings, we captured the overarching theme of each one. Each grouping either served as a key finding or supportive evidence for a key finding. Using our key findings and background research, we composed a set of recommendations. During our formation of recommendations, we conducted additional research to ensure that they weren’t underlied by conjecture.</p>
